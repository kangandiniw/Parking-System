# **Smart Parking System** 🚗  

This system is designed for **license plate and QR code detection**, aiming to streamline the entry and exit management of the **Dian Nuswantoro University parking lot in Semarang**. By automating the parking process, the system enhances efficiency and security.  

## **Technologies Used** 🛠️  

This **web-based system** is developed using the **Flask framework**, integrating various libraries such as:  
- **OpenCV** – for image processing and license plate detection  
- **EasyOCR** – for optical character recognition (OCR) on license plates  
- **pyzbar** – for QR code scanning and validation  
- **SQLite/MySQL** – for storing user and vehicle data  

## **Database Structure** 🗄️  

The current database design is structured for **scalability**, though it does not yet include relational dependencies.
