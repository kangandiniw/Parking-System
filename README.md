# Parking System
This is a system for detecting license plates, and qrcode. The purpose of making this application is to facilitate the management process in and out of the Dian Nuswantoro University parking lot, Semarang

## System Tools
This system is based on a website that we build using the flask framework, which we combine with various libraries such as opencv, easyocr, pyzbar, etc.

## Database Structure
